## What is Software Development?

- Computer Programming
- Designing, writing, testing and maintaining computer software.
- Using programming languages to create instructions that computer can understand and execute.
Humans go bla-bla-bla, computers go beep-boop
- These instructions can range from simple calculations to complex algorithms that control how computer interacts with its hardware and other software.

## What is Python?

- Python is high level interpreted programming language.
Focuses on simplicity, readability and ease of use.
- It is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variables do not need to be declared with a specific data type before they are used.
You don't need to specify that "age" will be a number before setting it to be a number.
- Python has a large standard library of pre-written code, which provides a wide range of functions and tools that can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks.
- It is widely used in web development scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning and many other areas.
See the notes for more info on 'Interpreted', 'open-source', 'syntax', and 'dynamically-typed'.

## What is Syntax?

- Syntax refers to the set of rules that define how programming language should be structured and written in order for the computer to understand and execute it correctly.
Similar to how human languages are structured so that people understand each other.
- These rules govern how keyboards, operators, functions and other elements of the language can be combined to create valid program statements.
Like nouns, verbs, adjectives etc
- A violation of these rules result in a syntax error. Syntax Errors are one type of error that can occur in software development.
Like French, computers can't deal with imperfect speech.

## What are standards?

- Software development standards (aka: coding standards or coding conventions) are a set of best practices that are used to ensure consistent and readable code across a development team or organization.
- Many software development standard are language-specific. That is standards for one language will differ from other languages. While other standards transcend languages.
Think of the standard form of english poems vs japanese haikus.
- Software development standards cover wide range of topics, including naming conventions, code formatting, documentations, commenting and error handling. 
- These standards ensure that code is easy to understand, maintain, and produces efficient results. Standards support software maintenance.
- Python Enhancement Proposals 8 (PEP *)
- Covers such as:
Code layout
String Quotes
Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
Comments
Naming Conventions
