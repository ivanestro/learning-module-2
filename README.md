### Learning Module 2

## What is Software Development?

- Computer Programming
- Designing, writing, testing and maintaining computer software.
- Using programming languages to create instructions that computer can understand and execute.
Humans go bla-bla-bla, computers go beep-boop
- These instructions can range from simple calculations to complex algorithms that control how computer interacts with its hardware and other software.

## What is Python?

- Python is high level interpreted programming language.
Focuses on simplicity, readability and ease of use.
- It is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variables do not need to be declared with a specific data type before they are used.
You don't need to specify that "age" will be a number before setting it to be a number.
- Python has a large standard library of pre-written code, which provides a wide range of functions and tools that can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks.
- It is widely used in web development scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning and many other areas.
See the notes for more info on 'Interpreted', 'open-source', 'syntax', and 'dynamically-typed'.
